# EC2 HyperV Dynamic Load Distributor

## Overview

The **EC2 HyperV Dynamic Load Distributor** is an API that helps balance the workload across EC2 virtual private servers (VPS) running Hyper-V. It uses a load-based optimization strategy to ensure that tasks are assigned to the least busy servers.

## Features

- **Automatic Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming tasks to the servers with the lowest current load.
- **Resource Monitoring**: Keeps track of CPU, GPU, and RAM usage on each server.
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Can create new VPS instances if resource usage exceeds set thresholds.
- **Hypervisor Management**: Manages virtual machines (VMs) within each Hyper-V server, with up to 3 VMs per server.
- **Failover Support**: Redirects traffic from failed servers to available ones to maintain service continuity.

## How It Works

1. **Monitoring**: The API constantly checks the resource usage of all EC2 VPS Hyper-V servers.
2. **Task Assignment**: When a new task comes in, it is assigned to the server with the lowest load.
3. **Scaling Up**: If all servers are heavily loaded, the API can create new VPS instances to handle additional tasks.
4. **VM Management**: Within each VPS, the API manages up to 3 VMs to efficiently utilize resources.
5. **Failover Handling**: If a server goes down, the API automatically redistributes tasks to other servers.

## Use Cases

- **AI and Machine Learning Applications**: Efficiently distribute computational tasks for AI models.
- **Web Services**: Balance user requests across multiple servers to improve response times.
- **Data Processing**: Manage workloads for applications that require high computational resources.

## Benefits

- **Improved Performance**: Ensures servers are not overloaded, leading to faster processing times.
- **Scalability**: Automatically adjusts resources based on demand.
- **Reliability**: Reduces downtime by handling server failures gracefully.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Optimizes resource usage, potentially lowering operational costs.

## Getting Started

1. **Setup**: Deploy EC2 VPS instances running Hyper-V with the desired specifications.
2. **Integration**: Incorporate the API into your system to start monitoring and managing loads.
3. **Configuration**: Set thresholds for resource usage to control when new VPS instances should be created.
4. **Testing**: Run tests to ensure that load balancing and failover mechanisms work as expected.

## Conclusion

The EC2 HyperV Dynamic Load Distributor simplifies the management of workloads across multiple servers. By automatically balancing loads and scaling resources, it helps maintain optimal performance and reliability for your applications.
